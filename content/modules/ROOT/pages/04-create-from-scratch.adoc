Starting from an existing base container isn’t the only option available
to `+buildah+`. `+Buildah+` can create a minimal container image that
contains metadata and a filesystem stub.

To create this style of image use the `+scratch+` special target for
`+buildah from+`.

[source,bash,run]
----
buildah from scratch
----

Since there’s no starting image, the working container will be called
`+working-container+`.

We can start working with the scratch container using tools on the host
by mounting the container filesystem on the host using
`+buildah mount+`.

____
_NOTE:_ We capture the output of the `+buildah+` command in the variable
_scratchmnt_ to make it easier to work with the filesystem path in these
exercises.
____

[source,bash,run]
----
scratchmnt=$(buildah unshare buildah mount working-container)
----

[source,bash,run]
----
echo ${scratchmnt}
----

Right now, that directory is empty.

[source,bash,run]
----
ls -l ${scratchmnt}
----
