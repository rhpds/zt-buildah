*Buildah* has two main ways to create images:

* Using subcommands to modify contents
* Using host tools to modify a container filesystem

First, weâ€™ll look at using subcommands to modify the container contents
before saving an image. Many *buildah* subcommands act like directives
from a Containerfile. This allows for a familiar experience while
automating builds.

The Red Hat Universal Base Image is provided as the starting point for
creating containers with Red Hat Enterprise Linux packages. More
information on UBI can be found in the
https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image[introductory
blog post.]

To build an application container from the `+ubi-init+` base image, we
will create a working container with `+buildah+`. A working container is
a temporary container used as the target for buildah commands.

[source,bash,run]
----
buildah from registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi-init
----

This subcommand acts like the FROM directive in a Containerfile and
makes the source image available on the host.

Buildah will append `+-working-container+` to the image name used. If
that name already exists, a number will also be appended.
